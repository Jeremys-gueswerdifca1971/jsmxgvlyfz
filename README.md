OMG, just watched The Woman in the Yard and my brain is like... what even? ðŸ¤¯ Seriously, what a rollercoaster. You know how some movies just grab you and yank you in a dozen different directions at once? Yeah, that was this one. One minute you're laughing, then you're like WHAT IS HAPPENING! And low-key, the protagonist is my hero â€“ she's got that don't-mess-with-me vibe.

> I downloaded the movie when I thought it'd be some light evening entertainment, but nope, it turned into this emotional black hole. ðŸ˜‚ The cinematography though, it was fire. Those close-up shots are haunting my dreams, no joke. And donâ€™t even get me started on the soundtrack, it slaps hard. So many feels!!

And honestly, the story had layers, like an onion or whatever. Not all good layers, but it kept you thinking, you know? There was this one scene where everythingâ€”like everythingâ€”just came crashing down, and I was like, Hold up, did they really just do that? My popcorn went flying, man. Like, did they forget to give the characters any chill? ðŸ“‰

So I kinda wanna watch the movie again, just to catch all the stuff I missed while my jaw was hanging open the first time. It's one of those, Wait, I need to understand wtf just happened situations. ðŸ™ƒ Oh, and shoutout to the side characters - surprisingly not annoying, thank god. ðŸ˜‚

On a totally unrelated note, I wonder if my plants are thriving or plotting my demise as I type this. Random thought, just popped into my head.

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(What was that ending?!)

Okay, that's enough brain dump for now. Need some serious unwinding time after that film, maybe with a good book or ten. ðŸ˜‚ You gotta tell me what you think when you see it, though, seriously!
